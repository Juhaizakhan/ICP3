## Task 1: Company and Employee Classes

### Description

This code defines two classes, `Company` and `Employee`, to manage employee information. The `Company` class keeps track of a list of employees and calculates the average salary of all employees. The `Employee` class is a base class, and there is a subclass `FulltimeEmployee` that inherits its properties.

### Usage

1. Create an instance of the `Company` class.
2. Create instances of the `Employee` or `FulltimeEmployee` class and add them to the company using the `add_employee` method.
3. Call the `average_salary` method of the company to get the average salary of all employees.
4. Access the `employee_count` data member of the company to get the total count of employees.

## Task 2: Numpy Array Manipulation

### Description

This code uses the NumPy library to create a random vector, reshape it into a 4x5 matrix, and replace the maximum value in each row with 0.

### Usage

1. Run the script.
2. The random vector and the reshaped array will be printed.
